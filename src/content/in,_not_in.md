## in, not in
The `in` and `not in` operators check if an element is present or absent in a collection (like a list, string, or dictionary).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruits)      # Check if "apple" is in the list
print("orange" not in fruits) # Check if "orange" is not in the list
```
```output
True
True
```
