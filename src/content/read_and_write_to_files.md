## Read and Write to files
You can read from and write to files using Pythonâ€™s `open()` function. Use `w` for writing, `r` for reading, and `a` for appending.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
```output
Hello, World!
```
