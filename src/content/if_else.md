## if else
`if else` statements allow you to execute code based on conditions. The `elif` keyword provides additional conditions.

```python
temperature = 30

if temperature > 35:
    print("It's a hot day.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a warm day.")
else:
    print("It's a cold day.")
```
```output
It's a warm day.
```
