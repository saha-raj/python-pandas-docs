## Logic and Comparison
Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are used for making comparisons and combining conditions.

```python
a = 5
b = 10

print(a == b)       # Equal to
print(a != b)       # Not equal to
print(a < b and b > 0)  # Logical AND
print(a > b or a < b)   # Logical OR
print(not a == b)       # Logical NOT
```
```output
False
True
True
True
True
```
