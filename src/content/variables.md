Variables are used to store data values in memory. They are like labeled containers that hold values, allowing you to use those values throughout your code.

```python
x = 10
y = 'ChatGPT'

print(x)
print(y)
```

```output
10
ChatGPT
```

## Data Types
Variables can store various data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and booleans. Hereâ€™s an example of different data types stored in variables.

```python
a = 5              # Integer
b = 3.14           # Float
c = "Hello World"  # String
d = True           # Boolean

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
```
```output
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'bool'>
```

## Value Reassignment
Variables can be reassigned new values and can be used in operations to create new variables.

```python
x = 8
y = x + 5

print(y)  # y is now 13 and its type is reassigned from string
```

```output
13
```
