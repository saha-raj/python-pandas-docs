## Usage
Variables are names that store values. They act as labeled containers for data.

```python
# assigning values to variables
x = 42
y = "Hello"
print(x)
print(y)
```
```output
42
Hello
```

## Assigning Multiple Variables
You can assign values to multiple variables in one line.

```python
# assigning multiple variables at once
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a)
```
```output
1
```
```python
print(b)
```
```output
2
```
```python
print(c)
```
```output
3
```



## Data Type Storage
Variables can store different data types such as integers, floats, and strings.

```python
# examples of storing various data types
num = 7         # integer
pi = 3.14       # float
text = "Python" # string

print(type(num))
print(type(pi))
print(type(text))
```

```output
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
```

## Updating Variable Values
Variables can be reassigned or updated using operations.

```python
# updating the value of a variable
count = 5
count = count + 3
print(count)  # count is now 8
```

```output
8
```
